# Object Oriented Programming Assignment (OOPs)

This repository contains the solutions to the Object Oriented Programming assignment for OOPs. Each question is implemented in Java and is organized in separate files.

## Part 1: Class and Objects

1. [**Vehicle Class:**]() Create a class `Vehicle` with `no_of_seats` and `no_of_wheels` fields. Create objects for `Motorcycle` and `Car` and display their descriptions.

2. [**Leap Year:**]() Create a method to decide if a given year is a leap year.

3. [**Rectangle Area:**]() Create a class `Area` with methods `setDim` and `getArea` to calculate and print the area of a rectangle.

4. [**Student Class:**]() Create a class `Student` with `name` and `roll_no` variables. Assign values to `name` as "John" and `roll_no` as 2.

5. [**Student Information:**]() Assign and print the roll number, phone number, and address of two students with names "Sam" and "John".

6. [**Triangle Area:**]() Print the area and perimeter of a triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5 units.

7. [**Add Distance:**]() Add two distances in inch-feet.

8. [**Average:**]() Print the average of three numbers entered by the user.

9. [**Complex Numbers:**]() Print the sum, difference, and product of two complex numbers.

## Part 2: Constructor, Method Overloading, and Objects

10. [**Movie Class:**]() Implement a `Movie` class with constructors and a method to get PG movies from an array.

11. [**Student Name:**]() Print student names. If no name is passed, default to "Unknown".

12. [**Grade Calculation:**]() Display grades according to marks entered by the user.

13. [**Print Numbers:**]() Print numbers of different data types using method overloading.

14. [**Print Integer and Character:**]() Print an integer and a character with two methods having the same name but different parameter sequences.

15. [**Print Square and Rectangle Area:**]() Print the area of a square and a rectangle using method overloading.

16. [**Student Details:**]() Print the name, age, and address of 10 students using array of objects.

17. [**Degree Class:**]() Implement a `Degree` class with subclasses `Undergraduate` and `Postgraduate`.

## Part 3: Inheritance, Interface, and Exception Handling

18. [**Shape Class:**]() Implement a `Shape` class with subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

19. [**Parent-Child Classes:**]() Implement parent and child classes and call their methods.

20. [**Rectangle and Square Area:**]() Calculate and print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square using inheritance.

21. [**Member Class:**]() Implement a `Member` class with subclasses `Employee` and `Manager`.

22. [**Abstract Class:**]() Implement an abstract class with a constructor and abstract and non-abstract methods.

23. [**Animals Class:**]() Implement an abstract class `Animals` with subclasses `Cats` and `Dogs`.

24. [**Shape Area Calculation:**]() Implement an abstract class `Shape` with methods to calculate the area of a rectangle, square, and circle.

25. [**Parent Class:**]() Implement a parent class with a method and its subclass with another method.

26. [**Bank Class:**]() Implement a `Bank` class with subclasses `BankA`, `BankB`, and `BankC`.

27. [**Java Interfaces:**]() Discuss why Java interfaces cannot have constructors but abstract classes can.

28. [**Instance Count:**]() Write a program to find the number of instances created for a given class.

29. [**Exception Handling:**]() Handle divide by zero, array index out of bounds, and null pointer exceptions.

30. [**Try and Catch Block:**]() Write a program to demonstrate the try and catch block.

## Part 4: Recursion

31. [**Last Even Digit:**]() Find the location of the last even digit from the end of a number.

32. [**Kth Digit:**]() Find the kth digit from the end of a number.

33. [**Sum of Even Digits:**]() Find the sum of even digits in a number.

34. [**Factorial:**]() Find the factorial of a number.

35. [**Delete First Digit:**]() Delete the first digit of a number.

36. [**Increment Even Digits:**]() Increment all even digits in a number.
