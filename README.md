# Object Oriented Programming Assignment (OOPs)

This repository contains the solutions to the Object Oriented Programming assignment for OOPs. Each question is implemented in Java and is organized in separate files.

## Part 1: Class and Objects

1. [**Vehicle Class:**](Assignment2/VehicleMain1.java) Create a class `Vehicle` with `no_of_seats` and `no_of_wheels` fields. Create objects for `Motorcycle` and `Car` and display their descriptions.

2. [**Leap Year:**](Assignment2/leap2.java) Create a method to decide if a given year is a leap year.

3. [**Rectangle Area:**](Assignment2/rectarea3.java) Create a class `Area` with methods `setDim` and `getArea` to calculate and print the area of a rectangle.

4. [**Student Class:**](Assignment2/) Create a class `Student` with `name` and `roll_no` variables. Assign values to `name` as "John" and `roll_no` as 2.

5. [**Student Information:**](Assignment2/) Assign and print the roll number, phone number, and address of two students with names "Sam" and "John".

6. [**Triangle Area:**](Assignment2/) Print the area and perimeter of a triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5 units.

7. [**Add Distance:**](Assignment2/) Add two distances in inch-feet.

8. [**Average:**](Assignment2/) Print the average of three numbers entered by the user.

9. [**Complex Numbers:**](Assignment2/) Print the sum, difference, and product of two complex numbers.

## Part 2: Constructor, Method Overloading, and Objects

10. [**Movie Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a `Movie` class with constructors and a method to get PG movies from an array.

11. [**Student Name:**](Assignment2/) Print student names. If no name is passed, default to "Unknown".

12. [**Grade Calculation:**](Assignment2/) Display grades according to marks entered by the user.

13. [**Print Numbers:**](Assignment2/) Print numbers of different data types using method overloading.

14. [**Print Integer and Character:**](Assignment2/) Print an integer and a character with two methods having the same name but different parameter sequences.

15. [**Print Square and Rectangle Area:**](Assignment2/) Print the area of a square and a rectangle using method overloading.

16. [**Student Details:**](Assignment2/) Print the name, age, and address of 10 students using array of objects.

17. [**Degree Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a `Degree` class with subclasses `Undergraduate` and `Postgraduate`.

## Part 3: Inheritance, Interface, and Exception Handling

18. [**Shape Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a `Shape` class with subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

19. [**Parent-Child Classes:**](Assignment2/) Implement parent and child classes and call their methods.

20. [**Rectangle and Square Area:**](Assignment2/) Calculate and print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square using inheritance.

21. [**Member Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a `Member` class with subclasses `Employee` and `Manager`.

22. [**Abstract Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement an abstract class with a constructor and abstract and non-abstract methods.

23. [**Animals Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement an abstract class `Animals` with subclasses `Cats` and `Dogs`.

24. [**Shape Area Calculation:**](Assignment2/) Implement an abstract class `Shape` with methods to calculate the area of a rectangle, square, and circle.

25. [**Parent Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a parent class with a method and its subclass with another method.

26. [**Bank Class:**](Assignment2/) Implement a `Bank` class with subclasses `BankA`, `BankB`, and `BankC`.

27. [**Java Interfaces:**](Assignment2/) Discuss why Java interfaces cannot have constructors but abstract classes can.

28. [**Instance Count:**](Assignment2/) Write a program to find the number of instances created for a given class.

29. [**Exception Handling:**](Assignment2/) Handle divide by zero, array index out of bounds, and null pointer exceptions.

30. [**Try and Catch Block:**](Assignment2/) Write a program to demonstrate the try and catch block.

## Part 4: Recursion

31. [**Last Even Digit:**](Assignment2/) Find the location of the last even digit from the end of a number.

32. [**Kth Digit:**](Assignment2/) Find the kth digit from the end of a number.

33. [**Sum of Even Digits:**](Assignment2/) Find the sum of even digits in a number.

34. [**Factorial:**](Assignment2/) Find the factorial of a number.

35. [**Delete First Digit:**](Assignment2/) Delete the first digit of a number.

36. [**Increment Even Digits:**](Assignment2/) Increment all even digits in a number.
