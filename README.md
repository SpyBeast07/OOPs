12. [**Grade Calculation:**](Assignment2/Grades12.java) Display grades according to marks entered by the user.

13. [**Print Numbers:**](Assignment2/PrintNumber13.java) Print numbers of different data types using method overloading.

14. [**Print Integer and Character:**](Assignment2/charint14.java) Print an integer and a character with two methods having the same name but different parameter sequences.

15. [**Print Square and Rectangle Area:**](Assignment2/RecSqArea15.java) Print the area of a square and a rectangle using method overloading.

16. [**Student Details:**](Assignment2/sdat16.java) Print the name, age, and address of 10 students using array of objects.

17. [**Degree Class:**](Assignment2/College17.java) Implement a `Degree` class with subclasses `Undergraduate` and `Postgraduate`.

## Part 3: Inheritance, Interface, and Exception Handling

18. [**Shape Class:**](Assignment2/Shape18.java) Implement a `Shape` class with subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

19. [**Parent-Child Classes:**](Assignment2/ParentChild19.java) Implement parent and child classes and call their methods.

20. [**Rectangle and Square Area:**](Assignment2/Rect20.java) Calculate and print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square using inheritance.

21. [**Member Class:**](Assignment2/company21.java) Implement a `Member` class with subclasses `Employee` and `Manager`.

22. [**Abstract Class:**](Assignment2/abstract22.java) Implement an abstract class with a constructor and abstract and non-abstract methods.

23. [**Animals Class:**](Assignment2/animals23.java) Implement an abstract class `Animals` with subclasses `Cats` and `Dogs`.

24. [**Shape Area Calculation:**](Assignment2/area24.java) Implement an abstract class `Shape` with methods to calculate the area of a rectangle, square, and circle.

25. [**Parent Class:**](Assignment2/message25.java) Implement a parent class with a method and its subclass with another method.

26. [**Bank Class:**](Assignment2/Bank26.java) Implement a `Bank` class with subclasses `BankA`, `BankB`, and `BankC`.

27. [**Java Interfaces:**](Assignment2/javaInterface27) Discuss why Java interfaces cannot have constructors but abstract classes can.

28. [**Instance Count:**](Assignment2/instance28.java) Write a program to find the number of instances created for a given class.

29. [**Exception Handling:**](Assignment2/except29.java) Handle divide by zero, array index out of bounds, and null pointer exceptions.

30. [**Try and Catch Block:**](Assignment2/arrexcpet30.java) Write a program to demonstrate the try and catch block.

## Part 4: Recursion

31. [**Last Even Digit:**](Assignment2/evendigit31.java) Find the location of the last even digit from the end of a number.

32. [**Kth Digit:**](Assignment2/kdigit32.java) Find the kth digit from the end of a number.
